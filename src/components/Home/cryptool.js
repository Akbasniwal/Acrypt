const tools = [

      </div>
    ),
    compute: (input) => {
      return atob(input);
    },
  }];

  we have tools array in tools.js file
  we want to use it in home.js file such that we can associate inputs in html of tools array with the compute function of tools array
  we would create react component which will take tool html and compute function as props and return the tool compute function with the input from tool html
